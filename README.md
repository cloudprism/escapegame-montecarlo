A Monte Carlo Simulation windows console application for calculating odds in the board game Escape: The Curse of the Temple

Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a real-time cooperative board game played with dice and tiles. 1-5 players have 10 minutes (the duration of the accompanying soundtrack included with the game) to coordinate their efforts and… escape the temple. They must do so by rolling their five dice each as fast as they can in order to explore the temple, activate the crystals, and find the exit. The dice are custom six-sided dice, with five unique values: a red torch, a blue key, a gold mask, a black mask, and a green explorer that appears on two sides of each die. Different tasks in the game require different combinations of dice values in order to be completed. For example, exploring a new room of the temple requires two green explorers, but activating a crystal in a particular room requires four red torches. Players start with five dice, and may roll and reroll any number of them in order to match their target. However, if a black mask shows up on a die, it is cursed and may not be used again until a gold mask is rolled, which will free two cursed dice. This means that it is possible for a player to eventually end up with all his dice cursed, unable to roll until he is assisted by another player’s gold mask. Players in the same room may combine and share dice in order to free each other’s cursed dice or accomplish a task, which is required for more difficult tasks involving a target of more than five dice, such as a room with the requirement of eight blue keys rolled in order to activate three crystals. Activating crystals is necessary for escape; once the exit has been found, a player may attempt to escape from the exit room by rolling more blue keys than there are inactivated crystals left in the crystal depot (which starts with 7-16 crystals in it depending on the number of players.)
